Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

ANSWER : select (*) from Business;
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
please specify which foreign key.

ANSWER : 

i. 	Business 	= 	10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’ of Business table
ii. 	Hours	= 	1562 distinct records for foreign key ‘business_id’
iii. Category 	= 	2643 distinct records for foreign key ‘business_id’
iv. 	Attribute = 	1115 distinct records for foreign key ‘id’
v. 	Review 	= 	10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’, 9581 user_id foreign key, 8090 business_id foreign key
vi. 	Checkin 	= 	493 distinct records for foreign key ‘buisness_id’
vii. Photo 	= 	10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’, 6493 buisness_id foreign key
viii. Tip 	= 	537 distinct records for foreign key ‘user_id’, 3979 buisness_id foreign key
ix. 	User 	= 	10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’
x. 	Friend 	= 	11 distinct records for foreign key ‘user_id’
xi. 	Elite_years = 2780 distinct records for foreign key ‘user id’

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
Viewing the count_reviews and fans, having a high review_count do not have a correlation to more fans. 
In my opinion, there is more to do with the  quality of the review the user has given, the length of time one is yelping and whether its useful for the 
community or not.

select name, review_count, fans
from USER
order by fans DESC
limit 10;

+-----------+--------------+------+
| name      | review_count | fans |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Amy       |          609 |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I have chose city as Las Vegas as it has 82854 reviews and 
subsequently chose Shopping as there were 4 businesses which was the highest among all the categories 
along with Health & Medical and Restaurants.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

For the category of Shopping, only one business qualified for the 2-3 group 
example - Walgreens and two for the 4-5 group 
example Desert Medical Equipment and Red Rock Canyon Visitor Centre. 
On comparison, Walgreens opens everyday from 8am to 10pm whereas the ones in 4-5 rating are open from 8 am to 4:30pm and 5 pm. 
So, there's a stark difference in the distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Comparing the reviews on the businesses, Walgreens has got 6 reviews whereas the 4-5-star businesses have 4 and 32 reviews respectively. 
It seems the one with 32 reviews such as Red Rock Canyon Visitor Centre is quite liked by the residents with 4.5-star rating.

         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

The location and the neighbourhood do not provide sufficient data to analyze the conclusion.

SQL code used for analysis:

select
       case
       when stars>=4 then '4-5 Stars'
       when (stars>=2 and stars<=3) then '2-3 Stars'
       end as rating,

       postal_code,
       review_count,
       hours.hours,
       name,
       neighborhood

from business inner join category
     on business.id=category.business_id
     inner join hours
     on business.id=hours.business_id

where city='Las Vegas'
      and category = 'Shopping'
      and (stars>=4 or (stars <3 and stars>2))

order by stars desc, hours desc;

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
On average, the businesses that are opened are tend to have more reviews if compared to the closed ones.

Open	:  	AVG(review_count) = 31.76
Closed: 	AVG(review_count) = 23.2        
         
ii. Difference 2:

The average star rating are higher for the opened businesses if compared to the closed businesses.

Open	:   	AVG(stars) = 3.68
Closed: 	AVG(stars) = 3.52
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS Number_of_business,
	ROUND(AVG(review_count),2) AS avg_review,
	SUM(review_count) AS total_review,
	ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS avg_rating,
	is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open;

+--------------------+------------+--------------+------------+---------+
| Number_of_business | avg_review | total_review | avg_rating | is_open |

|               8480 |      31.76 |       269300 |       3.68 |       1 |
+--------------------+------------+--------------+------------+---------+


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Predicts the number of fans a user will have is an interesting problem to consider according to me.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

After studying the ER diagram, there are a few points that strike to mind that can be useful on predicting the number of fans a user will have such as the number of useful reviews, 
years active on Yelp, whether he/she is an elite member and for how long, 
compliments received from users and more. 
There could've been a lot of other analysis that could've been done based on other factors like the quality of the review made, 
review sentiment analysis, rating of the business for which the review was made more, but I haven’t considered all these in the current analysis.

The result of the analysis are as follows:
a) There wasn't much effect being an e;ite member on the number of fans. as most of the high fan users aren't an elite member.
b) On average, a user has been on Yelp for 7 years.
                                      
iii. Output of your finished dataset:        
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

	(MAX(year)-MIN(year)) as elite_year,
